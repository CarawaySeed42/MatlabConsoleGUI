# MatlabConsoleGUI
A user interface that acts as a MATLAB console window

# What is this for
The Matlab console is a very useful replacement for calculators built into the OS.<br>
This GUI tries to serve as a distributable user interface for people who use Matlab as their calculator or the plot simple graphs.<br>
If you have Matlab installed on your computer and have a valid license then great, this program will not make your life too much easier.<br>
But compiled as a Standalone Application you can give other people the ability to use simple Matlab functionality.<br>

# Things to know
- As Standalone Application only built-in Matlab functionality can be used, if functions are not expclicitly included during compilation
- Matlab GUIDE Text Boxes are not very developer friendly, which made workarounds necessary in regards to text box scrolling

# Why was this created
- For fun
- For people who use Matlab as a calculator

# Binaries
A compiled version of the GUI is included in this repository.<br>
To run it, you need the Matlab Runtime for [version 2019b](https://de.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)

# Example
- Example image shows simple Matlab command that can be executed with the return key
- You can also define and use arrays or other multi dimensional objects - e.g. arr = [1, 2, 3 , 4];
